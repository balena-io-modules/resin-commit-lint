# resin-commit-lint

A script to lint commit messages.
A valid commit starts with the title, which is made of an optional prefix, separated from the subject by a colon.
The body, which may contain a detailed description of your changes, should be separated from the title by an empty line.
Footers may appear at the end of the commit, separated from the body by a newline.

Scroll to the Rules sections to learn about the specific rules, the default
configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/resin-io/resin-commit-lint/blob/master/config.json)


## Examples

```
prefix: Subject

A body which may contain several paragraphs.

It must contain footers separated by a newline

Change-type: major
Signed-off-by: Foo Bar <foobar@resin.io>
```

Since the prefix is optional the following is also a valid commit

```
subject without prefix

A body

Change-type: minor
Signed-off-by: Foo Bar <foobar@resin.io>
```

You can also only add footers, in this case you still need to add the extra empty-line for the (empty) body.

```
title


Change-type: minor
Signed-off-by: Foo Bar <foobar@resin.io>
```

# Usage
Takes the commit message as input and validates it according to the rules.

```
commit=$(git show $SHA -s --format=%B)
resin-commit-lint "${commit}"
```

You can override the [default configuration](https://github.com/resin-io/resin-commit-lint/blob/master/config.json) with the `-c` option

# Tips
You can configure `git` to help you follow these guidelines by creating a commit
template. To enable this, simply add this to you `.gitconfig`

```
[commit]
  template = path/to/your/template
```

You can customise your template according to your own needs, here is an example
which you can use to build on:
```
prefix: Subject

Commit body

Change-type: patch|minor|major
Signed-off-by: Your Name <yourname@resin.io>
```
