# resin-commit-lint

A script to lint commit messages, a valid commit starts with the title, which is
made of a prefix, separated from the subject by a colon, the next lines may
contain the body of the commit followed by the footers.

Scroll to the Rules sections to learn about the specific rules, the default
configuration can be found [here](https://github.com/resin-io/resin-commit-lint/blob/master/config.json)


## Examples

```
prefix: Subject
A body which may contain several paragraphs.

It must contain footers separated by a newline

Change-type: major
Signed-off-by: Foo Bar <foobar@resin.io>
```

# Usage
Takes the commit message as input and validates it according to the rules, you can pipe the input directly from `git show`.

```
git show $SHA -s --format=%B | resin-commit-lint
```

You can override the [default configuration](https://github.com/resin-io/resin-commit-lint/blob/master/config.json) with the `-c` option

# Tips
You can configure `git` to help you follow these guidelines by creating a commit
template. To enable this, simply add this to you `.gitconfig`

```
[commit]
  template = path/to/your/template
```

You can customise your template according to your own needs, here is an example
which you can use to build on:
```
prefix: Subject

Commit body

Change-type: patch|minor|major
Signed-off-by: Fake Name <fakename@resin.io>
```
